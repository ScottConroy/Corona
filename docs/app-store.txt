Below is a rough description of the sample app.

Kind of funny that it's a sample app _store_ that shows how to use marklogic as a json _store_.


1) Load json from android market data.  Note data only contains 2 categories for now.  We can fetch more later. 
Also need to write a script that will fetch the icons and load those into marklogic for now (so app can run
locally without internet connection).  Icons are at http://www.android.com/market/data/screenshots/{classname}N.png
where N is either empty string (for icon), or 0, or 1 for screenshots.
(Like, http://www.android.com/market/data/screenshots/com.andoop.freerunning0.png ).

Also load data for palm app store.
thumb is icon.  This adds 'version', 'orientation', 'price', 'devices', 'requirements'.
Can make up (random or blank) this data for android.

(Perhaps cons up simple form for manually adding new apps/editing existing ones; no image upload at first; do this 
later when needed).

2) Provide a one-box search interface that searches 
title, description, category_label, author, 

3) Search results should display a (scrollable/pagable) list of apps
Icon
Highlighed App title 
(Highlighted Snippet ?)

4) Clicking on a search result should show in page (like android.com/market) an app
with 
Title
Author (with link to site)
Description
Screen shots

5) Provide facets on 
category/category_label
author
free or paid, bucketed cost 0, (0, 1], (1, 2], (2, 3], (3, 4], (4,5], (5, 10], (10, 15], (15, 20], (20, inf]
featured or not
orientation
devices
requirements

6) "Instant" style filtering of results based on currently typed stuff in one-box
(also updating facets).

7) Once that's working, then add ability for someone to (a) provide a review and/or (b) rank the app (0-5).  
Make review comments searchable in one-box as well and show up in search results if the hit is there.  


8) Optional, use css that will make the app work ok on iphone/android/palm browsers.
